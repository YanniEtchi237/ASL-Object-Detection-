# Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) Detection with YOLO

This project aims to develop a real-time ASL detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system can recognize ASL gestures and signs from video input in real-time, making it useful for various applications, including communication aids for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Features

- Real-time detection of ASL gestures and signs from video input.
- User-friendly interface for interacting with the ASL detection system.
- High accuracy and speed in recognizing ASL signs across different lighting conditions and hand orientations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asl-yolo-detection.git
cd asl-yolo-detection

Usage
Run the ASL detection system:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system:
Use the camera to capture video input.
View the real-time detection of ASL signs overlaid on the video feed.
Receive feedback on the recognized ASL signs.
